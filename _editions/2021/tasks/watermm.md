#### Task Description
The WaterMM Task deals with the analysis of social media posts from Twitter with regards to issues of water quality, safety and security. The participants of this task are provided with a set of Twitter post IDs in order to download the text, the attached image and the metadata of tweets that have been selected with keyword-based search that involved words/phrases about the quality of drinking water (e.g., strange color, smell or taste, related illnesses, etc.). Because the occurrence of such phrases in a tweet might not necessarily reflect a case of water contamination, participants are asked to build a binary classification system that will be able to distinguish whether a post is relevant or not to water-quality issues. 

The dataset is bilingual (English and Italian), and participants can tackle the task by using textual information, visual information, metadata or a combination of the above.

*Participants are encouraged to make their code public with their submission.*

#### Motivation and background
The rise of social media has led to discussion of a broad range of topics related to everyday life. One of the topics that we expect to be mentioned in social media posts is water quality, safety and security. The acquisition of posts containing citizen complaints on the condition of drinking water, as an addition to traditional means such as phone calls, could support situational awareness in a water distribution network. However, within the post stream we expect that number posts containing water-quality related keywords do not refer to actual cases of polluted water. To minimize the incoming noise, automatic prediction of a postâ€™s relevance is required. Filtering out irrelevant posts will improve the quality of the information that water utilities receive from social media.
<!-- # In this sentence above, expand water utilities to include other relevant organization. It is not clear, for example, that Eastern Alps River Basin District is a water utility. Note that countries differentiate between public and privte utilities.

Research on developing classifiers for social media monitoring is often related to *sudden crisis* (see last year's [Flood-related Multimedia Task](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/floodmultimedia/)). Studying water quality allows us to expand the scope in include so-called *creeping crisis*, i.e., a dangerous situation emerges slowly. 

The dataset is bilingual (English and Italian) to encourage researchers to tackle the real-world challenge of multiple languages in the data.

#### Target group
Researchers in the areas of social media, multimedia and multilingual analysis, multimedia classification and information retrieval are strongly encouraged to participate in the WaterMM Task. Industries and SMEs that develop similar AI technologies for semantic data fusion and retrieval of multi- or cross-lingual content are also warmly invited to participate. Furthermore, the challenge could be interesting to researchers and practitioners in water-related domains, such as water engineering, water distribution, and water management in general.

#### Data
The dataset is a set of social media posts collected from Twitter during one year (from May 2020 to April 2021) by searching for English and Italian keywords inside the tweet text about water quality (e.g. issues with drinking water, signs of water pollution, illnesses related to water). In order to be fully compliant with the Twitter Developer Policy, only the IDs of the tweets are distributed to the participants, but a tool to download them is also provided.

#### Ground truth
The ground truth of the dataset reflects the relevance of a tweet (relevant / not relevant) and has been manually collected with human annotation, realized by the Eastern Alps River Basin District, who are responsible for hydrogeological defense, i.e., the protection of water resources and aquatic environments, in the Eastern Alps partition of North-East Italy.

#### Evaluation methodology
The evaluation metric for the binary classification of tweets as relevant (1) or not relevant (0) will be F-score.
<!-- # Please considering adding: We also encourage participants to carry out a failure analysis of their results in order to gain insight in the mistakes that their classifiers make.-->

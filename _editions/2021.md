The MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation benchmark offers tasks that are related to multimedia retrieval, analysis, and exploration. Participation is open to interested researchers who register. MediaEval focuses specifically on the human and social aspects of multimedia, and on multimedia systems that serve users. They offer the opportunity for researchers to tackle challenges that bring together multiple modalities (visual, text, music, sensor data).

### Participation
Currently we are calling for task proposals. For examples of the type of tasks that will be offered, please see the [MediaEval 2020 webpage](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/). We will start posting the task list to this page in March and the list will be complete in April.
